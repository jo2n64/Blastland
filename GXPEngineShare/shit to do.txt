-fix shit ton of bugs


VERY NEXT THINGS:
-add different weapons (gun (endless supply of bullets), flamethrower(flames), knife) - done on 18/02/2020, took about an hour and a half, very core mechanics (havent made the flamethrower use fuel, as well as just not use the flamethrower when picked; make the pistol spawn the bullets instead of the bullets themselves/player?)
-add powerups (life pickups (+1 health, slower movement), shooting rate (less time between shots), damage increase (increase bullet damage), fuel(increase fuel amount)) - done on 17/02/2020, took around 2 hours
-add health to player, enemies and bosses - done on 14/2/20

-add behaviour to enemies:
	-walking left to right - reverse speedX when hitting walls - done on 14/2/20
	-spike enemies (objects in tiled) - have two anim frames and add a bool that checks if the enemy is up - done on 18/2/20
	-add tiles for just spikes - done on 14/2/20
	-explosive enemies (objects in tiled) - when killed, increase the scale if it's lower than 3 or smth, if player collides in that, he takes damage - done on 20/2/20
	-shooting enemies - shoot bullets in the direction of the player (but not follow !!!!!!!!) - made them shoot but not follow the player (kms)
	-following enemies - just follows the position of the player - done on 18/2/20
-add behaviour to bosses:
	-level 1 boss - every certain seconds it spawns enemies from 2/3 spawn points - done on 19/2/20
	-level 2 boss - every certain seconds it shoots bullets in a line - done on 22/2/20
	-level 3 boss - every certain seconds it shoots homing missiles (constantly following the player, but they can be destroyed if the player hits them)
-add animations to the player
-add animations to enemies and bosses for all of their behaviours
-add a idle screen (for inserting coin, and you can start playing only if you insert a coin) - dun?
-add a screen between levels

MAJOR BUGS THAT NEED FIXING:
-fix the scrolling - it's weird rn
-make the enemy bullets not disappear when on screen (cause they do)
-fix player collision with walls
-fix enemy collision with walls
-player sticks to wall when tries to go diagonally - DUN
-fix the player movespeed when he dies - he goes way too slow - dun i guess
-tweak up how the flamethrower works (right now he just appears even when you dont use fuel)
-CODE MANAGEMENT - OPTIONAL IF TIME IS LEFT


THINGS TO ASK
-resolution - full HD (wtf)
-size of tiles

-HOW DO THE WEAPONS WORK (A

GAME RULES
-controls
	-two buttons - one for shooting, one for switching weapons
	-8-directional movement (with an arcade stick
-types of enemies (all of them have 5 health):
	-walking left to right - moving really fast between the boundaries (walls)
	-spike enemies - reappear from the ground - if they are showing and player collides with them, player takes damage
	-permanent enemies (spikes?) - just deals damage, doesnt move
	-explosive enemies - makes an explosion in a radius, where if the player is in the radius, he takes damage
	-shooting enemies - shoot out stuff
	-following enemies - go straight down
-types of bosses
	-level 1 - 25 health, spawns enemies
	-level 2 - 50 health, shoots bullets
	-level 3 - 75 health, shoots homing missiles
-types of weapons
	-flamethrower - 3 damage?
	-regular weapon (gun) - 1 damage
	-machete (5 damage, 1 hit kill enemies, high risk-high reward)
-types of powerups
	-extra life (if you take an extra life and your life is maxed out you get fat (slower movement speed but you get more health - when you lose your max health so does the slowing goes)
	-faster shooting rate
	-increase damage (which stack no matter what other powerups you get inbetween) - negative effect - get dealt +1 damage from general enemies for 20-30 secs
	-fuel for flamethrower
